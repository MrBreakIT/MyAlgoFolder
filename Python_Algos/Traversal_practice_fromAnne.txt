# Having trouble showing/changing data in lists and dictionaries?
# Ask yourself, "can I print JUST the thing I want BEFORE I try to change it?"

customers = [[20,50],[35,10],[0,8]] # looks intimidating, but let's break it down, going from big to small:

print(customers) # shows a list of lists
# Well, we know how to find things in a list...
print(customers[1]) # shows a single list
# So customers[1] is a list! We can do to it whatever we can do to any other list, like use indexes:
print(customers[1][1]) # shows a single number in a single list
customers[1][1] = 15 # changes the second number in the second list in the list of lists
print(customers) #shows a list of lists

vips = [
    {'name':'Bob', 'location':[20,20]},
    {'name':'Jane', 'location':[10,2]}
]

print(vips) # list of dictionaries
print(vips[0]) # dictionary
# So vips[0] is a dictionary! And we know we can look at values in dictionaries based on their keys, so:
print(vips[0]['name']) # this shows us a string
vips[0]['name'] = "Robert" # changes the string in the dictionary in the list
print(vips) # list of dictionaries

my_faves = {
    'food':'sushi',
    'color':'gray'
}

print(my_faves) # dictionary
print(my_faves['food']) # the value at the key location 'food', which is a string
my_faves['food'] = 'sammiches' # changes the value at 'food'
print(my_faves) # let's see the change!
