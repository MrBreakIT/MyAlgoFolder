// There are built in methods like parseInt and parseFloat available to convert a string to number. We can also do this by simply providing a unary operator (+) in front of string value.

//longhand
let total = parseInt("453");
let average = parseFloat("42.6");

//shorthand
let total = +"453";
let average = +"42.6";
